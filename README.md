# Farid's Personal Site

This is the code behind my personal website.
It's super simple, just like me üòé

- Built with love (and a bunch of caffeine)
- Deployed via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
- Nothing fancy, just vibes

That's it for now. Thanks for stopping by and checking out my site!
